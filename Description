Stock Investment Dashboard: Analysing Financial Data for Investment Decisions
In this project, I took on the role of a Data Scientist/Analyst for a startup investment firm, aiming to assist clients in making informed investment decisions. The primary objective was to create a dashboard that extracts, analyses, and visualises key financial data for popular stocks, including Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. The dashboard would help identify patterns and trends that could influence investment strategies. My functions were downloaded from https://aroussi.com/post/python-yahoo-finance.
To accomplish this, I used Python for data extraction and data visualization, incorporating web scraping and financial data libraries. I also leveraged tools such as Skills Network Labs and IBM Watson Studio, which provided a cloud-based environment to handle data and develop the project. The key focus was on displaying financial performance indicators clearly and interactively, using Plotly for rich visualization. The IDE I chose for use was the PyCharm community edition.
